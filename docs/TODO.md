## High Priority 🔴

### 1. Fix Remaining Test Failures (8 tests)

**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Remaining Failures**:
- 4 cleaning tests (PlaceCleaner/NameCleaner reporting issues - functionality works)
- 1 name parser epithet extraction test
- 3 validation tests (DateValidator, LivingStatusValidator, ConfidenceTierSystem)

**Note**: Most failures are in test expectations/reporting, not core functionality.

### 2. Fix People/Families Repair Blocking Issue

**Status**: Investigation Needed
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

**Problem**: After running events repair, people/families repair appears to be blocked.

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Add detailed logging to people/families repair endpoint
- [ ] Check for database locks after events repair
- [ ] Verify transaction commit/rollback in events repair
- [ ] Test repair sequence isolation
- [ ] Check for foreign key constraint violations

**Potential Fixes**:
- [ ] Add explicit transaction cleanup between repairs
- [ ] Implement connection reset between repair operations
- [ ] Add database checkpoint after each repair
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running operations

**Files to Investigate**:
- `gedmerge/web/api/main.py` (repair-all, events, people endpoints)
- `gedmerge/rootsmagic/adapter.py` (transaction management)

### 4. Debug Remaining 500 Errors

**Status**: One bug fixed (db.connection), others need investigation
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Completed**:
- ✅ Fixed `db.connection` → `db.conn` bug in places/analyze

**Remaining Tasks**:
- [ ] Add `exc_info=True` to all error logging
- [ ] Test all repair endpoints after database connection fix
- [ ] Check for missing imports (NameParser, PlaceCleaner)
- [ ] Verify all database operations use correct connection attribute
- [ ] Add request validation to catch bad inputs early
- [ ] Create integration tests for all repair endpoints

**Enhanced Error Logging Template**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in {operation}: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Consider adding:
    #   - Request context
    #   - Database path
    #   - Current record ID
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```
